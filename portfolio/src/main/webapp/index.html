        <p class="about-paragraph">
          Welcome to my portfolio website! I am Malcolm and I am from 
          Winston-Salem, NC. Currently I am studying computer science at North 
          Carolina Agricultural and Technical State Universty. My journey in
          computer science began when I was younger. Growing up I was an avid 
          gamer. I loved playing videogames with my brothers and my friends. 
          When I was 10 years old, my dad gave me a book on videogame development.
          At that time it never crossed my mine that I could be a person to create
          the awesome games that I was playing. I was hooked and from then on I would
          learn about programming and computer science. Although videogame development
          was my initial spark into computer science I have grown to learn more 
          about the field. I have learn about different languages and 
          technologies. I have learned about web development and mobile 
          development. One of the greatest things I love about computer science 
          is the broadness of the field and that anyone can find a aspect of 
          the field that they enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
          As I mentioned earlier, I am a computer science student at NC A&T. Along with 
          my passion in computer science I am also passionate about the environment
          and I am a proponent of sustainbility. I aspire to use my skills and talents
          in computer science to solve some of the greatest challenges concerning
          the environment. I believe technology and computer science are a big 
          part of the overall solutions to solving issues related to the environment.  
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">  
          Outside of my academics I enjoy going for walks, being outside,
          reading, and cooking. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends and being
          with my family. My friends and I are always talking about series, 
          movies, or anime we are watching. If not talking about entertainment
          we are discussing anything thats on our mind or going on in the world.
