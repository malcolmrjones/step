        <p class="about-paragraph">
          Welcome to my portfolio website! I am Malcolm and I am from 
          Winston-Salem, NC. Currently I am studying computer science at North 
          Carolina Agricultural and Technical State Universty. My journey in
          computer science began when I was younger. Growing up, I was an avid 
          gamer. I loved playing videogames with my brothers and my friends. 
          When I was 10 years old, my dad gave me a book on videogame development.
          At that time it never crossed my mine that I could be a person to create
          the awesome games that I was playing. I was hooked and from then on
          I would dive into the exciting world of programming and computer 
          science. Although videogame development was my initial spark 
          into computer  science I have grown to learn more about the field. 
          I have learn about different languages and technologies. I have 
          learned about web development and mobile development. One of the 
          greatest things I love about computer science is the broadness of the 
          field and the field that they enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
          As I mentioned earlier, I am a computer science student at NC A&T. 
          Along with  my passion in computer science I am also passionate about 
          the environmentand I am a proponent of sustainbility. I aspire to use 
          my skills and talents in computer science to solve some of the 
          greatest challenges concerning the environment. I believe technology 
          and computer science are a big part of the overall solutions to 
          solving issues related to the environment. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">  
          Outside of my academics I enjoy going for walks, being outside,
          reading, and cooking. My favorite color is green. My favorite foods 
          are philly cheesesteak subs and sweet potato fries. My favorite movie
          franchise is Star Wars. Some of the genres of music I listen to often 
          are R&B, Lo-Fi, Hip-Hop, and Classical. I also enjoy hanging out 
          with my friends and being with my family. My friends and I are always 
          talking about series, movies, or anime we are watching. If not talking
          about entertainment we are discussing anything thats on our mind or 
          going on in the world.
